# Force-Directed-Graph

This project provides the implementation of force directed graph visualization. This visualization is commonly used to display social networks in a pleasing and easy-to-understand way [- wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing). 

` IMPORTANT: The code is not optimized for handling large number of nodes. Instead, it takes advantage of Unity3d physics engine to create the visualization. `
